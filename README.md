## Projects

### 1. Auto-Correct Tool & Translator App
- **Technologies**: AI & ML
- **Description**: This project involves the development of a text auto-correct tool and a translation app. The auto-correct tool corrects spelling errors in real-time, while the translator app translates text from one language to another.
  
### 2. Wine Quality Prediction
- **Technologies**: Machine Learning (ML)
- **Description**: This project predicts the quality of wine based on various input features such as alcohol content, acidity, sugar levels, and other chemical properties. The model is trained on a dataset to provide predictions.

### 3. House Price Prediction
- **Technologies**: Machine Learning (ML)
- **Description**: This project focuses on predicting house prices based on features like the area of the house, number of rooms, location, and other related factors. The model uses regression techniques to make accurate price predictions.
